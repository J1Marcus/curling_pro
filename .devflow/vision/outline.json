        "question": "What core problem does this product solve?",
        "recommendedAnswer": "CurlingPro addresses the lack of accessible, high-quality digital curling games. Real curling requires specialized facilities (ice rinks, equipment, teams) that most people don't have access to. The game solves this by providing: (1) Authentic curling physics including curl mechanics, sweeping effects, and realistic ice friction, (2) Progressive learning through tutorials and AI coaching for newcomers, (3) Competitive depth through career progression from Club to Olympic level, and (4) Social play via online multiplayer with ranked matchmaking.",

        "question": "What makes this product different from alternatives?",
        "recommendedAnswer": "CurlingPro differentiates through: (1) Physics realism - implements authentic curl mechanics where rotation rate affects trajectory, real friction coefficients, and proper collision physics with coefficient of restitution; (2) Comprehensive game modes - Learn Mode with interactive tutorials and AI coach suggestions, Career Mode with 8-tier tournament progression (Club to Olympics) featuring persistent rivals and personality-driven AI opponents, Practice Mode with 24+ drills, and Online Multiplayer with ELO rankings; (3) 3D immersion - dynamic camera transitions, detailed arena that scales with career level (sparse club crowds to packed Olympic stadiums), procedural crowd reactions; (4) Mobile-first PWA design with intuitive touch controls.",

        "question": "How will success be measured for this product?",
        "recommendedAnswer": "Success metrics would likely include: (1) Engagement - active players, session length, games completed, career progression rates; (2) Retention - daily/weekly active users, percentage completing Learn Mode tutorials, players reaching higher career tiers; (3) Multiplayer adoption - online games played, ranked match participation, player ratings distribution; (4) Quality - physics accuracy (split times matching real curling benchmarks: ~14s hog-to-hog for draw weight), positive feedback through the in-app bug report/feature request system; (5) Growth - PWA installations, organic sharing of room codes for multiplayer. The detailed physics timing instrumentation in the code suggests accuracy is a key quality benchmark.",

        "recommendedAnswer": "No monetization model is evident in the codebase. The game appears to be free-to-play with no in-app purchases, ads, or premium features currently implemented. The MIT license suggests it may be an open-source passion project. Future monetization opportunities could include: cosmetic unlocks (stone designs, club crests), premium tournament entries, or removing theoretical ads. The detailed career progression and unlockable country representation at National tier could support a freemium model.",
