[Jonathan Marcus] 07:56:22
Fucking kidding me!

[Marcus Swift] 07:56:24
Hi, sorry, man.

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:56:25
I thought it's on by default!

[Marcus Swift] 07:56:27
No, I have to turn it on.

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:56:30
Shit. Don't bother now.

[Marcus Swift] 07:56:31
Yeah. Well, I can… I can sit and dictate this to all… well, I have this document, my flow, documented.

[Marcus Swift] 07:56:39
in… in the back end, so, um…

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:56:42
So I'd almost like to do it the other way, like I said, you know, instead of saying create a…

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:56:47
a backend requirement based on the front end, do it the other way around. It's a…

[Marcus Swift] 07:56:49
do a front-end requirement based on the back end, yeah.

[Marcus Swift] 07:56:53
Well, transcripts are on now, so, uh, let me… let me say…

[Marcus Swift] 07:56:58
When…

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:56:59
Oh, gosh, when I listened to this whole thing,

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:57:02
This is gonna go on.

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:04
Uh, well, it only starts from the moment I turn it on, so, uh…

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:10
Uh, okay, so…

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:57:11
Right. Okay.

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:13
Um…

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:15
I think your onboarding process is…

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:19
pretty bang on.

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:20
Uh, we just need to start

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:23
interjecting the session agent sooner in the process.

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:27
So, when the…

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:30
When the person signs up,

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:32
We get their initial consent,

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:35
And then immediately they get a UI that says,

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:38
How do you want to do your data collection?

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:42
Do we want to do it right, like, here, with…

[Marcus Swift] 07:57:46
I don't know the language, but UI-based, or…?

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:57:47
So, one of the questions we need to modify

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:57:50
So one of the questions I think we need to modify is we're kind of assuming right now, based on the way the front end is,

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:57:56
is that the person that the user is the subject of the book.

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:58:01
And…

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:01
Not necessarily, right? So that's where…

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:05
That's why I think the onboarding of the user

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:58:06
No, that's the way it currently is, I'm saying.

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:09
Right, right, right, right.

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:58:09
That's what needs to be modified.

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:11
Yeah, that's right, because I think the onboarding of the user is…

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:15
Where you basically sign up for the service, and then the storyteller

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:20
could very well be a different person.

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:58:23
Yes. But…

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:23
Right? It could be, I'm… I'm signing up my mom, because I want this for me.

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:29
And so I want to, you know, so then…

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:32
then there needs to be…

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:35
a, uh, the session agent

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:39
then says, okay, I've been activated, oh, nothing's been done. My first step.

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:44
is to reach out to the storyteller,

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:47
probably through an email, saying, this is what's been initiated,

[Marcus Swift] 07:58:52
Uh, click the link to accept, and start the process.

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:58:54
Yes, but also acknowledging the fact that the storyteller, even the storyteller, isn't necessarily the subject of the book. That it could be about someone else.

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:02
Exactly. Exactly, right? And so then, when a storyteller comes in,

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:59:03
Correct.

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:08
kicks off the session agent. The session agent says, what are… what are… what are on the requirements?

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:14
And the session…

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:16
would need to… the requirements, this is new, so I'm glad we got the transcripts on, the requirements would need to be linked to the story… to a storyteller.

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:23
So, what are the requirements that are needed for this storyteller?

[Jonathan Marcus] 07:59:27
Right.

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:28
And then… and then the session starts, right? So when the UI would become… would be coming up for the storyteller for the first time, it would be like, great,

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:37
Here's a video describing what we're doing from… from the team, or here's a…

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:44
orientation flow of some kind.

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:46
And we… and we get consent to record

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:50
to persist and to… and we do the same kind of onboard… or no, sorry, so then…

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:56
We get all that kind of consent, okay, we're good.

[Marcus Swift] 07:59:59
And then this session starts, and the session can be…

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:02
Do you want to schedule a callback?

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:04
So we could do that over the phone. Do we want to do it…

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:08
Um, right here in the app.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:00:10
Yes.

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:10
very simple A-B test, right? Great, I want to do it in the app, great.

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:15
Do you want to… do you want to be able to just dictate your answers? Do you want us to…

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:21
read out our questions to you, or do you want to read them yourself, right? So, do we activate a voice agent?

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:26
Or do you, right, boom. Okay, great. And then the session kicks off.

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:31
Right? And the session…

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:33
does it such any things? It says, here's the next question, and the UI is designed to accept

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:39
One question at a time.

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:41
It renders the question,

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:43
And it allows for the input based on the user's preference.

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:47
So, if it's…

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:49
If they selected a phone call, it's like, great, do you want us to call you right now? Do you want to schedule your next… the phone call to happen?

[Marcus Swift] 08:00:57
If they say, I want to do it on the app, this is great. Do you want us to read out the question, or do you want us to…

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:02
draw the… write the… write the question out on the… on the app.

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:05
They select, and it fires the next question.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:08
So, one of the things that we…

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:09
the user inputs in the way that they want.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:11
One of the things we also talked about is sort of during the initial onboarding, um, establishing what the product options are,

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:19
Uh, explaining to them what the…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:22
time commitment is of each one, and the expectations from them, and then also guidance on terms of, like, you know, when you're doing this, make sure you're in a quiet room, you know, so there's no background noise, stuff like that.

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:24
Yeah.

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:25
Yeah, but that's…

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:31
Yeah.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:34
Um, that kind of thing.

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:34
Yeah. But that could all be part of the trust-building flow, right? So… so… so we don't need to pre-design the UI to have that.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:38
Yeah.

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:42
the back end will start firing off those questions, and those protocols

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:47
Okay.

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:47
as they're relevant and necessary, right? So the…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:49
I just want to have it for the sake of the transcript, to kind of have everything in here. The other thing…

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:52
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:55
we talked about is changing it from, like, chapters to subjects.

[Marcus Swift] 08:01:58
Right.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:01:59
Um, talking about more character development, uh, cognitive anchoring, we talked about.

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:03
Yeah.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:02:04
Um, so just kind of mentioning things, again, for the sake of the transcript here.

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:07
Sure.

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:09
From a UI front-end perspective,

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:13
Um…

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:15
the way I envision it right now is it's… it… it could very well be a very…

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:21
very simple UI, because a lot of what needs to get rendered is going to get pushed from the back end.

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:26
And it's just going to be a very static kind of…

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:30
Question and input.

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:32
Great question and input. Once they're into the pro step of actually generating,

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:37
Then the whole thing around

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:39
How do they… how do we present the story arc?

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:43
So, once they get to the point where there's enough life events,

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:47
That we've got a story arc.

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:49
and the beats, and the themes, and the character development, how does that all get rendered to the user?

[Marcus Swift] 08:02:55
And again, whether they're voice-based and they're doing it on the phone,

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:00
This is… is app-based. It has to be app-based, right? They need to be able to visually see

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:05
the story development, and if a storyteller never wants to see that, they don't have to.

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:11
But they can go in and they can see, okay, this is the arc that's forming,

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:15
Here's how it's starting to get organized.

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:17
Here's… here's the formation of the memoir and how it's starting to take shape, and they can

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:23
edit, they can interact with the memoir, they can…

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:26
You can do pieces in that.

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:28
As well, right? So…

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:31
you know, initial onboarding, the session,

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:37
a page where the session gets managed.

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:41
archetype Age, where the archetype is

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:43
is more like a dashboard for the story process.

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:46
And then in editing UI where they can interact with the manuscript and start to…

[Marcus Swift] 08:03:54
give it shape and all that. And then a resolution, a finishing, a, okay, yeah, this is great.

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:01
let's, um…

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:04
let's publish it, and what are they publishing options, and all those pieces, right?

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:09
That's what I'm seeing as kind of some fundamental front-end stuff that we can start building now.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:04:19
Okay?

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:20
What do you think? What do you thinkin'?

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:04:27
Nothing.

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:28
Okay, alright.

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:30
Um…

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:33
And at some point here, Jonathan, I may… I may get you

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:37
into working on some of the back-end processes as well, once the front end is kind of…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:04:40
Sure.

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:41
done, because this is… this project, I think, is going to be back-end heavy.

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:45
Um, and…

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:47
And certainly…

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:49
Uh, the biggest…

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:51
kicker in this… in this… and this is partly why I was thinking Kickstarter as well.

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:56
is, um…

[Marcus Swift] 08:04:59
It may take it 6 to 8 months to get to the point where we've got a product that we can actually

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:04
put in front of people and start billing money for, right? Because…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:05:07
Which is… I know, which is the…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:05:11
Um…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:05:13
We're trying to set a deadline here of, like,

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:05:16
5 months, like, 5 to 6 months, right?

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:19
And I don't know if we've got 5 to 6 months of runway.

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:22
So… it…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:05:23
No, that's what I mean. I'm trying to base it on the runway, yeah.

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:26
Yeah, so, you know, if we've got that much run rate, then great, because I think it… with concerted effort,

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:32
we could probably get something out the door that starts billing.

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:36
in 5 to 6 months, for sure.

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:39
Um, well, not for sure, but that seems reasonable to me.

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:42
Uh, to do it in a month or two, and say, you know, and we gotta start billing on this?

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:47
Um, maybe if we focus just on the obituary side of it, we could make it a tighter…

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:53
process. We don't have to deal with multiple archetypes, there's only one.

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:57
Um, it's not…

[Marcus Swift] 08:05:58
the memoir isn't as long.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:05:59
Let me… let me ask you a question. For Judy, how did you do your obituary?

[Marcus Swift] 08:06:04
Uh, her sister did it.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:06:05
Okay, and where was it published?

[Marcus Swift] 08:06:09
It was a part of the, uh…

[Marcus Swift] 08:06:12
memorial home.

[Marcus Swift] 08:06:15
Um, and I don't know if it was a service they offered, but what happened was…

[Marcus Swift] 08:06:20
The funeral was livestreamed.

[Marcus Swift] 08:06:23
And prior to…

[Marcus Swift] 08:06:25
the livestream, the video link went out, and people could go and watch the video,

[Marcus Swift] 08:06:31
Um, or prior to or post the memorial, they could… they could watch the video, and at any point after the funeral, they could…

[Marcus Swift] 08:06:38
They could watch the funeral service as well.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:06:45
Um, you just gave me a totally interesting idea.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:06:49
So, the reason I was originally asking you, and then I'll go into my idea, um…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:06:55
But the…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:06:58
The reason I was… because normally obituaries, you think about just, like, newspaper…

[Marcus Swift] 08:07:02
Sure.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:07:03
kind of things. But I think that's sort of out, right? Nobody's… like, who even subscribes to a newspaper in order to get an obituary?

[Marcus Swift] 08:07:09
Right.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:07:09
Right, so what other… so how, like…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:07:12
how do you even do an obituary? Where do you even send it to? Is it, like… I mean, I know there's, like, websites of stuff, but…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:07:19
really, who the hell's going on those things, looking at that? I mean, it's kind of… so where's the value? Who's gonna spend money to write… to have that done? That's where I sort of disagree a little bit with the…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:07:31
Would the value proposition of what you're saying on there.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:07:34
But… but…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:07:36
I know that I've been to funerals where they do have, like, while you're sitting before, like, you're sitting in the gathering area, before you go into the

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:07:44
into the ceremony area, there's the videos, right? What if we sell the… is there a product that could be sold to the funeral homes to help them generate a more… not just a slideshow?

[Marcus Swift] 08:07:45
Exactly.

[Marcus Swift] 08:07:51
Exactly. Exactly.

[Marcus Swift] 08:07:55
Yeah. Exactly.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:07:55
But a more engaged…

[Marcus Swift] 08:07:57
Yeah, we white-label this as something that the funeral home has paid for and is branded for… it's an internal service for their customers.

[Marcus Swift] 08:08:07
that, that, you know,

[Marcus Swift] 08:08:09
They… they sell.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:08:09
But how… what's the product there? Like, how can… if we were to sell to a funeral home, basically a product that would help them enhance their… their video packaging kind of thing, right? It's totally different than what we're doing here, because it's not a prose, right?

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:08:22
It's… there might be…

[Marcus Swift] 08:08:23
It is and it isn't. I mean, it's not that much different than a PowerPoint presentation.

[Marcus Swift] 08:08:27
So, it's just tuning the AI to generate a PowerPoint presentation, rather than a

[Marcus Swift] 08:08:33
than a memoir, right? It's just a different archetype.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:08:38
Hold on just a second. Emerick, where… how do you… my daughter's sitting on the other side working, and she sent me a text saying, I look at obituaries.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:08:45
Um, like, how? What do you…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:08:48
Oh, you're on video, by the way, so just…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:08:51
I googled them, I looked at Alans.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:08:53
You Google them? They're fine.

[Marcus Swift] 08:08:56
Are they on… what, sorry, what's your daughter's name?

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:08:58
I can't open this door. Put one at a time.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:09:03
Yes. Okay, yeah.

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:06
What's your daughter's name?

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:09:07
Amber?

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:08
Amber. Amber, do… are they websites that you're looking at?

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:09:12
Yeah.

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:13
Okay, alright, so they, they are… because that was my thought as well, Jonathan, is that we tie this into our…

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:19
our web service, where we, like,

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:21
We produce a website for you.

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:24
That is a memorial, it lends for 2 years, or, you know, or as long as…

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:29
You want to keep paying for us to host the website, and we host the website that is a multimedia

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:35
Living Memorial, a digital tombstone.

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:38
of the person in their life.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:09:40
That's a totally different… I mean, it could be a part of this product, but it's something we haven't discussed yet, and it's sort of an idea. But I'm just thinking,

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:43
Yeah.

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:46
Correct.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:09:48
Again, we're talking the business-to-consumer versus business-to-business. I like the idea of being able to sell business to business, and so the idea of going to, um…

[Marcus Swift] 08:09:52
Right.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:09:59
to funeral homes, because they're… you know, then they get to use it over and over and over. So the value for them is much higher. It's a more expensive product we could sell, right? So…

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:07
Right.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:10:09
But what is the product? Like, how do we… how do we give them something… enough value, more than what they

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:16
Well, my pushback on that is the product is…

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:20
is right now, they say to their… their people, I'm assuming,

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:25
you know, we've got to upload the videos, upload… you develop it.

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:30
We'll present it to…

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:32
the attendees, right? Whereas this is…

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:35
We assist in your…

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:37
family members in developing this.

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:41
Um, obituary in a way that is respectful, that is delightful, that is…

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:47
That is… that is well…

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:50
written based on their lived experiences,

[Marcus Swift] 08:10:52
Um, and we also then offer them an upsell of a short storybook of the person's life, and uh, right?

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:10:59
Okay, so you're saying a totally new product that doesn't exist right now. You go to a funeral, you almost get, like, a program.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:11:08
Like, but not just that has, like, a little bio about the person,

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:11:14
But, like, sort of a pamphlet, a 5-, 6-page pamphlet,

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:11:18
that tells a story, a full story about that person.

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:24
Possibly, I hadn't seen it that way, but, um…

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:27
I was seeing it more as…

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:29
the PowerPoint presentation that gets presented at the funeral about their life.

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:35
But we could easily then produce that as a…

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:38
as a memorial,

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:41
token that gets handed out or ordered by individuals

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:45
Uh, that is a…

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:48
5 to 20 page…

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:51
Beautifully bound book that they can order.

[Marcus Swift] 08:11:54
That is memorializing the person's life.

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:00
It's not a memoir.

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:02
But it… it's a collection of stories and images that they could per… like… like a yearbook.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:03
No, no.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:05
No.

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:07
But for a person's life.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:07
Yes, but I think… I think we're sort of… we're going down parallel, but different roads here, because again, you're talking business-to-consumer versus business-to-business. I'm thinking this is a service we sell to the…

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:12
Sure, okay.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:17
to the funeral home, because it's a value-added to the consumer, but they're the ones

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:21
Yes.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:21
taking on the obligation of

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:23
putting it all together.

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:24
Yes. Yeah. But that would be what we would be selling to the funeral home, is the service is…

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:31
to your family members,

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:34
Right.

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:35
our service can produce the following things. We can white label it, you can subscribe,

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:40
you know, it's $100,000 a year,

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:43
And you get unlimited use. Boom.

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:46
Off you go, right?

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:47
Ooh, even better, yes.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:51
Um…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:52
Oops, uh…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:12:54
Hold on, I have to respond to a text here.

[Marcus Swift] 08:12:56
Sure. Again, I don't want to spend too much of our time this morning talking about this, because this is always…

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:03
This is likely going to change, and I think Jake needs to be…

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:06
This… this… this is something that…

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:09
I don't know how to tune him in around this, but it's like, look, if we're gonna spend the time doing this, do you need to get serious about

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:15
putting some people behind…

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:18
making this happen? Or Jonathan and I are just gonna run with this idea without you.

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:24
You know, because it's like, you know, this is gonna become our idea, then great. If he wants to be in it, I'm not interested in possibly creating wealth.

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:30
for someone else. I'm just not.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:13:31
Exactly, exactly.

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:32
You know? So, you need to get in the game.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:13:36
But again, my point right now is that we can't be… we can't play that hardball game right now

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:41
Not yet.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:13:41
Because we don't…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:13:43
it's very… the messaging is what's most important for the next 4 months.

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:47
Yeah, no, I hear you. I hear you. And…

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:51
Um…

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:53
Again, I think he's done a couple of things that…

[Marcus Swift] 08:13:56
you know, the therapist to me says I can understand it, the business person to me says,

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:01
shake it off and get going, you know? I don't do sales, the fuck you don't.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:05
Right.

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:05
You want this thing to work? Figure it out, buddy. That's what we're doing.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:08
Yeah, exactly. But I just don't want him to…

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:09
Um, so get off your ass and start selling.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:12
I don't want that to cost me, you know,

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:14
Yeah, no, exactly. That's why I didn't say anything.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:15
$30,000 or $40,000.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:17
Yeah.

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:18
And that's why I'm saying it to you, is that… but that message needs to be communicated to Jake. The fact that I've reached out to him

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:25
This morning, and I didn't hear from him.

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:27
is… annoying.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:29
Yeah. I mean, he's 2 hours ahead of you.

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:30
You know, uh, we're taking this serious.

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:32
Exactly. I knew that, so I reached out to him at 8.30.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:37
Right.

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:37
you know, it's now 10.15 his time.

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:41
Still haven't heard from you.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:42
Right.

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:43
So… how serious is he about this?

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:47
I don't know.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:49
Right.

[Marcus Swift] 08:14:49
Doesn't encourage me. So, you know, Jake needs to get tuned in a little bit around this, but…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:52
I might have that conversation with him, actually, to… to… to sort of…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:14:57
Yes, set some expectations that this is not SureGuard.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:01
Yeah. This is survival, man, so start acting like that.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:15:05
Right. Right, exactly.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:07
You know, there is nothing off the table. There is…

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:10
I'm not available for 2 weeks. There…

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:13
I don't do sales.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:17
That's the role we need you to play right now, man.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:15:19
Right, exactly.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:21
So, we got an idea,

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:23
You need to get off your ass, either hire people or start talking to funeral homes, tell us if this is gonna be viable.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:29
It is? Great! Let's keep going down that road.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:15:32
Right.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:32
How do we turn this into a viable product? That's not on you and me.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:15:36
Right.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:36
That's on him.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:39
Right? We'll execute the plan.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:42
that… that he thinks is sellable.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:15:46
Again, it's just very careful, gotta be careful.

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:48
Yeah, that's why I… that's why you're saying it, not me, because I… I… I… I…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:15:52
Right. Even I gotta think about how to do it and be really careful not to…

[Marcus Swift] 08:15:54
I have… I have the therapist voice that can say hard things to people, and…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:16:00
Yeah.

[Marcus Swift] 08:16:00
And not activate the defenses, but uh… I also don't have a relationship with him, so…

[Marcus Swift] 08:16:05
as much as you and Adam do, so…

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:16:08
Yeah, I have to… I don't want to…

[Marcus Swift] 08:16:08
Yeah.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:16:10
start a conversation, and then all of a sudden get my foot in my mouth.

[Marcus Swift] 08:16:14
Sure. Understood.

[Marcus Swift] 08:16:18
Okay, uh, can we pivot?

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:16:18
Okay.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:16:20
Yeah, I want to see this thing you're excited to show me.

[Marcus Swift] 08:16:23
Yeah, man.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:16:23
And we can probably turn off the transcript if you want.

[Jonathan Marcus] 08:16:26
Or save it at this point.

[Marcus Swift] 08:16:26
Uh, once I've started it, I don't know how to stop it,
