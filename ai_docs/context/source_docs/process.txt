Life Story Capture → Book Formation

Process & Flow Document

Core Design Commitments (Non‑Negotiables)
	1.	Context before meaning
Memory retrieval precedes narrative interpretation.
	2.	Scope before structure
Users choose what they are telling before how much.
	3.	Archetypes are structural, not prescriptive
They guide synthesis internally and are shown only on request.
	4.	User remains the author at every step
The system proposes, reflects, verifies, and pivots.
	5.	The system builds an outline first, not a book
Book formation is incremental and reversible.

⸻

High-Level Flow (Canonical)

Trust → Scope → Context → Capture → Synthesis → Verification → Book

⸻
TRUST BUILDING AND PERMISSION
⸻

Phase 1: Introduction & Trust Setup

Purpose
	•	Reduce anxiety
	•	Set expectations
	•	Prevent over‑disclosure or paralysis

What the user is told
	•	“We’ll build an outline first, not the book.”
	•	“You can skip anything.”
	•	“You decide how much of your life we focus on.”
	•	“Nothing is locked in.”

Outcome
	•	Psychological safety
	•	Willingness to proceed

⸻

Phase 2: Scope Selection (Critical Fork)

Purpose

Ensure the user is never locked into “my whole life”.

User-facing choice

What would you like to focus on right now?

	•	☐ My whole life story
	•	☐ One major chapter of my life
	•	☐ A specific life event or period
	•	☐ I’m not sure yet (help me choose)

Internal effect

Scope determines:
	•	How much context is required
	•	Which sections are enabled
	•	How synthesis is performed
	•	What “completion” looks like

⸻

Phase 3: Gentle Profile (Context + Boundaries)

Purpose
	•	Eliminate irrelevant prompts
	•	Earn trust
	•	Prevent awkward or harmful questioning

Format

Checkboxes / pickers only (no essays)

Domains

Life structure
	•	Relationships (partnered / previously / never)
	•	Children (yes/no)
	•	Family structure (parents, guardians)
	•	Major careers (one / multiple)
	•	Lived in multiple places (yes/no)
	•	Military or service roles (yes/no)
	•	Faith/spirituality important (yes/no)

Comfort boundaries
	•	Comfortable discussing romance (yes/no)
	•	Comfortable discussing loss/trauma (yes/no)
	•	Prefer to keep some material private (yes/no)

Output

An internal eligibility map that controls:
	•	Which sections appear
	•	Which prompts are tiered or suppressed

⸻
HISTORY AND FACT BUILDING
⸻

Phase 4: Contextual Grounding (Facts Before Story)

Purpose

Enable memory retrieval by loading time/place/role cues.

Rules
	•	Factual
	•	Chronological
	•	No interpretation
	•	No emotional language unless volunteered

Depending on scope:

Whole life
	•	Birth year (or approximate)
	•	Where you grew up
	•	Schools attended (optional)
	•	Major moves (cities only)
	•	Work phases
	•	Relationship anchors (optional)
	•	Children birth years (optional)

Major section
	•	When this chapter began/ended
	•	Where you were living
	•	Primary roles at the time

Single event / period
	•	What immediately preceded the event
	•	Who was involved
	•	Where you were in life at the start

Output

A chronological scaffold used to organize prompts.

⸻

Phase 5: Section Selection (Narrative Lanes)

Purpose

Avoid “tell me everything” paralysis.

Structure
	•	Core sections enabled by default
	•	Conditional sections toggled by profile and scope
	•	User sees lanes, not obligations

Core sections (examples)
	•	Origins (if whole life)
	•	Childhood
	•	Teen Years
	•	Early Adulthood
	•	Work & Purpose
	•	Values & Beliefs
	•	Milestones & Turning Points
	•	Lessons & Legacy

Conditional sections
	•	Love & Partnership
	•	Parenthood
	•	Service & Sacrifice
	•	Major Adventures
	•	Caregiving / Illness / Loss

⸻

Phase 6: Guided Story Capture (The Engine)

Purpose

Generate rich, book‑grade material without asking users to “write.”

Key Principle

Scene-based, one prompt at a time.

Prompt Pack Template (used everywhere)
	1.	Scene – “Take me to a specific moment…”
	2.	People – “Who was there? What were they like?”
	3.	Tension – “What was uncertain, hard, or unresolved?”
	4.	Change – “Did anything shift for you?” (optional)
	5.	Meaning – “Looking back, what do you notice now?” (tri‑valent)

Guardrails
	•	Short answers encouraged
	•	Voice optional
	•	Users may skip or stay at headline level
	•	Before deepening: consent check
(“Want to zoom in, or stay broad?”)

⸻

Phase 7: Progressive Unlocking

Purpose

Reduce overwhelm and build momentum.

Flow
	1.	Origins / Context (if applicable)
	2.	Early sections unlocked first
	3.	Later sections unlock once sufficient material exists
	4.	Branching paths offered based on profile and scope

⸻

Phase 8: Sensitive Topic Handling

Purpose

Preserve dignity, safety, and choice.

Tiered model
	•	Tier 1 (safe): general relationships, friendships
	•	Tier 2 (optional): romance, intimacy, grief specifics
	•	Tier 3 (private): material captured but not published

User controls:
	•	What is written
	•	What is included
	•	What remains private notes

STORY FORMATION
⸻

Phase 9: Synthesis Checkpoints (Provisional)

Purpose

Create visible progress without fixing meaning prematurely.

What happens
	•	System assembles a read‑only chapter draft
	•	Draft is explicitly labeled provisional
	•	Raw story inputs remain accessible

Follow-up prompts (2–3 max)
	•	"One more specific moment would strengthen this."
	•	"Anything here feel off or missing?"
	•	"Would you like to leave this as is?"

⸻

Phase 10: Archetype Organization & Selection

Purpose

Organize captured material into narrative structures with chapters, scenes, themes, and characters.
Allow multiple archetypes to emerge and compete, with the best fit becoming clear over time.

How it works
	•	System analyzes material for:
	•	Threat vs endurance vs transformation
	•	Identity before/after
	•	Relationship to loss, agency, meaning
	•	Selects multiple candidate archetype(s) that fit the material at:
	•	Whole work level
	•	Section level (if relevant)
	•	Maps material to potential narrative structures:
	•	Chapters (major thematic divisions)
	•	Scenes (specific moments and events)
	•	Themes (recurring patterns and meanings)
	•	Characters (people and their roles in the story)

Archetype evolution
	•	Multiple archetypes may be selected initially
	•	As more material is captured, best-fit archetype(s) emerge naturally
	•	System tracks which archetype provides strongest coherence
	•	Archetypes remain flexible until composition phase

User visibility
	•	Hidden by default
	•	Revealed only if the user asks for:
	•	"story map"
	•	"narrative shape"
	•	help structuring the book

Verification language

"This currently reads like a journey through loss toward connection. Does that feel accurate, or would you frame it differently?"

Immediate pivot if misaligned.

⸻

Phase 11: ANALYSIS (Gap Identification & Requirements)

Purpose

Based on selected archetype(s) and organized material, identify what needs to be explored further to inform strong story formation.

Analyst Agent responsibilities
	•	Evaluates current material against archetype requirements
	•	Identifies gaps in:
	•	Character development and relationships
	•	Scene depth and sensory detail
	•	Thematic continuity
	•	Emotional arc progression
	•	Timeline and chronological coherence
	•	Lodges specific needs in Requirements Table

Requirements Table structure
	•	Requirement ID
	•	Type (scene detail, character insight, thematic exploration, etc.)
	•	Priority (critical, important, optional)
	•	Related archetype lane
	•	Suggested prompts or exploration angles
	•	Status (pending, addressed, resolved)

Session Agent integration
	•	Requirements Table feeds into next session planning
	•	Sessions Agent selects appropriate requirements based on:
	•	User's current engagement state
	•	Section they're working in
	•	Natural conversation flow
	•	Presents requirements as organic follow-up questions
	•	Updates table as requirements are addressed

Sufficiency gates
	•	Minimum material thresholds per archetype
	•	Character presence and development benchmarks
	•	Scene density and distribution
	•	Thematic coherence indicators
	•	Once gates are passed, system enables composition phase

⸻

Phase 12: COMPOSITION (Story Writing)

Purpose

Once sufficiency gates are passed, begin assembling material into book-grade narrative.

Composition process
	•	Chapters assembled from verified drafts
	•	Material organized according to best-fit archetype
	•	Scenes arranged for narrative flow and impact
	•	Tone calibrated from "book type" choice
	•	Themes woven through structure
	•	Character development tracked across chapters
	•	Optional closing section: Lessons / Legacy

Editor Agent responsibilities
	•	Reviews composed chapters for:
	•	Narrative coherence and flow
	•	Tonal consistency
	•	Pacing and scene balance
	•	Character consistency
	•	Thematic clarity
	•	Structural alignment with archetype
	•	Lodges edit requirements in Edit Requirements Table

Edit Requirements Table structure
	•	Edit ID
	•	Chapter/section affected
	•	Issue type (flow, pacing, clarity, consistency, etc.)
	•	Severity (blocking, important, polish)
	•	Specific concern or opportunity
	•	Suggested approach
	•	Status (pending, in review, resolved)

Iterative refinement
	•	Editor Agent flags issues without auto-fixing
	•	Edit requirements presented to composition process
	•	User maintains final authority on all edits
	•	System proposes, user decides
	•	Material refined through cycles until quality gates pass

Outputs

Depending on scope:
	•	Full memoir
	•	Section-focused book
	•	Single-event memorial narrative

⸻
BOOK CREATION
⸻
- process of approval
- printing
- audio book variation
- delivery


⸻
Final Design Principle (Anchor This)
⸻

Scope determines context.
Archetype determines structure.
Meaning always belongs to the user.

This process:
	•	Respects how memory works
	•	Aligns with narrative therapy ethics
	•	Avoids forced redemption
	•	Produces real books, not just reflection

If you want, next steps could be:
	•	turning this into a formal spec
	•	pressure‑testing single‑event mode end‑to‑end
	•	or defining exact “completion criteria” per scope
